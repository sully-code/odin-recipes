    <h3>My Favorite White Chicken Chili Recipe</h3>
    <p>Flavorful White Chicken Chili made with hearty beans, tender chicken, and a rich and creamy broth. It’s a lighter alternative to traditional beef chili and makes for a super satisfying dinner! If you’re lucky to have any left it will make great leftovers for lunch the next day too. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: I prefer rotisserie chicken but left-over cooked chicken will work great too.</li>
        <li>Garlic and onion: these aromatics adds lots of flavor here. Use fresh minced garlic.</li>
        <li>Chicken broth: for even more flavor try this soup with a homemade broth.</li>
        <li>Green chilies: be sure to buy the mild kind unless you like heat.</li>
        <li>Cumin, Paprika, Oregano & Coriander: these creates the perfect blend of spices here.</li>
        <li>Cannellini Beans: great northern beans will work great too.</li>
        <li>Frozen corn: canned corn will work too, I just never have cared for the flavor.</li>
        <li>Neufchatel cheese: cream cheese will work great too. I usually use Philadelphia but the store was out.</li>
        <li>Lime: be sure to use fresh lime not the bottled stuff here.</li>
        <li>Cilantro: feel free to add more to taste.</li>
        <li>Desired toppings: I like to add avocado, tortilla chips, and cheese.</li>
    </ul>    
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a 6 quart enameled Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add onion and saute 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and saute 30 seconds longer.</li>
        <li>Add chicken broth, green chilies, cumin, paprika, oregano, coriander, cayenne pepper and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Bring mixture just to a boil then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse beans in a fine mesh strainer or colander then measure out 1 cup.</li>
        <li>Set whole beans aside, transfer 1 cup beans to a food processor along with 1/4 cup broth from soup, puree until nearly smooth.</li>
        <li>Add Neufchatel cheese to soup along with corn, whole beans and pureed beans and stir well. Simmer 5 to 10 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken, fresh lime juice and cilantro. Serve with Monterrey Jack cheese, more cilantro, avocado slices and tortilla chips if desired.</li>
    </ol>
