In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. These recipe pages will include right-sized photos of the respective dishes, in addition to various ordered and unorders lists.

At a later date, I will revisit this project to style it up with CSS.
